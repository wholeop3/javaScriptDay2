# Project Summary

In this project, we'll provide practice JavaScript problems to help you better understand `callbacks`.

## Setup

* `Fork` this repository.
* `Clone` your fork.
* Open `./practice.js` with your code editor.
* Open `./index.html` with your browser.

## Directions

Complete all <b>7</b> activities inside of `./practice.js` to make the spec runner pass it's tests. In order to check the progress of the spec runner, open `./SpecRunner.html` with your browser. Remember to commit and push your code often. Good luck!

## Tips and Tricks

One of the biggest tools at the developer's disposal is the browser's built-in debugger. To use it, open `./index.html` with your browser. Another great tool for small and isolated pieces of code is <a href="http://www.pythontutor.com/visualize.html#">Python Tutor</a>. Just make sure to change the code to `JavaScript ES6`.

<summary> <code> Callbacks </code> </summary>

```js
// Most simply, a callback is a function that is passed as an argument to another function.
// That might look one of two ways:

// Example 1

// This is a generic function, it could be doing anything, but here it's just returning a string

function imDoingIt() {
  return 'Did it!';
}

// This next function expects a function as an argument for our cb parameter.
// Functions that receive functions as arguments are called higher-order functions.
// We know it expects a function because we're invoking cb within the functions body.
// cb is not a special keyword. Like any parameter, it's just a placeholder.
// We could call it catfish or hotdog if we wanted, but that wouldn't make a lot of sense. 

function doTheThing(cb) {
  return cb();
}

// Here we invoke doTheThing, passing it the imDoingIt function's definition (that just means we didn't invoke the passed in function).
// The imDoingIt function is aliased as cb in the function above, which we then invoke in our function body.

doTheThing(imDoingIt); // the result of calling this function is 'Did it!'

// Example 2

// In this example, we do the exact same thing, except instead of using a named function (imDoingIt) we're using an anonymous function as the passed in argument to doTheThing.
// An anonymous function is just a function without a name.

function doTheThing(cb) {
  return cb();
}

doTheThing(function() {
  return 'Did it!';
});

// ------------------

// The callback pattern is often used in asynchronous programming,
// and we'll see more of that later, but here's a simple example
// (note: this is hypothetical code (pseudo code) and is for example only):

function login(processUserCbFunc) {
  let user = fetchUser() // This is a fake function that takes time to run. It will log the user in, getting the users data                            // from the server.
  // When fetchUser finishes running, we want to tell JavaScript to do something with the user's data
  processUserCbFunc(user);
}

function processUser(user) {
  return 'The logged in user is ' + user.name;
}

// log the user in and when that's done, process them
login(processUser)

// --------------------

//Another common use case for the callback pattern is code reuse.
// Let's imagine you're processing bank transactions (deposits and withdrawals).
// You might write your code like this with callbacks.

// Transaction is a function that expects a dollar amount, and a callback function called action

function transaction(amt, action) {
  // rather than adding this if statement to make sure we're dealing with valid dollar amounts in both the deposit and withdraw functions below, we can write it once here.
  // This helps keep our code D-R-Y (Don't Repeat Yourself)
  if (amt <= 0) {
    return 'Please use a valid amount';
  }
  // As long as the amt is greater than 0, we'll perform our action (invoke our callback function) passing in the amt.
  return action(amt);
}

// a function that would deposit the given amount
function deposit(amt) {
  return 'You deposited $' + amt;
}

// a function that would withdraw the given amount
function withdraw(amt) {
  return 'You withdrew $' + amt;
}

// In these four invocations we call our transaction function with an amount,
// and a callback representing which action we want to perform with the given amounts.

transaction(100, deposit); // 'You deposited $100'

transaction(50, withdraw); // 'You withdrew $50'

transaction(-40, withdraw); // 'Please use a valid amount'

transaction(-100, deposit); // 'Please use a valid amount'

// As you can see above, callbacks provide a pattern for reusing chunks of
// code and grouping/reducing our logic (in this case our simple if statement
// that applies to both deposits and withdrawls).

// In review:

// a callback is a function passed as an argument to another functions invocation
// a higher-order function is any function that receives a function as an argument to it's invocation
// from above: transaction(deposit) => transaction would be the higher-order function and deposit would be the callback
// The callback pattern (or more simply, using callbacks in our code) allows us to write cleaner code with less repetition
// Callbacks are often used for asynchronous programming (think requesting data, logging a user in, etc.)
