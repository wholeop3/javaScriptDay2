# Project Summary

In this project, we'll provide practice JavaScript problems to help you better understand `Objects`.

## Setup

* `Fork` this repository.
* `Clone` your fork.
* Open `./practice.js` with your code editor.
* Open `./index.html` with your browser.

## Directions

Complete the first <b>4</b> activities inside of `./practice.js` to make the spec runner pass it's tests. In order to check the progress of the spec runner, open `./SpecRunner.html` with your browser. Remember to commit and push your code often. Good luck!

If you have extra time, try to complete the remaining activites.

## Tips and Tricks

One of the biggest tools at the developer's disposal is the browser's built-in debugger. To use it, open `./index.html` with your browser. Another great tool for small and isolated pieces of code is <a href="http://www.pythontutor.com/visualize.html#">Pyton Tutor</a>. Just make sure to change the code to `JavaScript ES6`.

<details>

<summary> <code> Objects </code> </summary>

```js
// declare an object with properties
let car = {
  make: 'Ford',
  model: 'GT',
  year: 2019,
  // This is a method (function) on the object
  reverse() {
    return 'Backing Up! Beep! Beep! Beep!'
  }
}

// adding or updating properties with dot notation
car.miles = 100;

// adding or updating properties with bracket notation
// if miles already exists on the object, this would change it's value
// if it doesn't this will set it as a key with a value of 150
car['miles'] = 150

// if a property doesn't exist on an object, it's considered undefined

car.owner === undefined // true

// A function contained in an object is called a method
// You can add functions to an object just like any other property

car.drive = function() {}

// You can invoke the method by accessing the function (method) on the object

car.reverse(); // 'Backing Up! Beep! Beep! Beep!'
- or -
// Though the dot notation version above is more common
car['reverse'](); // 'Backing Up! Beep! Beep! Beep!'
```

<summary> <code> Object Factories </code> </summary>
 
 ```js
// Functions that return objects are called object factories
// They're a blueprint for creating a lot of objects of one type

function createCar(make, model, year) {
  // the returned object has a property called make whose value is the argument passed to the make parameter above
  // it's the same for model and year
  return {
    make: make,
    model: model,
    year: year
  }
}

createCar('Ford', 'GT', 2006); // { make: 'Ford', model: 'GT', year: 2006 }
createCar('Tesla', 'Model S', 2019); // { make: 'Tesla', model: 'Model S', year: 2019 }
```
